#+title: Seminar 1: Introduction to how to run seminars

Information TBA. This seminar serves two purposes:

1. Meta: How to run seminars (by example)
2. Topic: What kind of programmer are you? 

Not all programmers are equal. This is of course true from several
standpoints, but here we focus on two key issues for running software
projects: staffing, and planning. 

We will discuss how there can possibly be a 10-25 factor in
productivity /difference/ between different programmers, go through
some meaningful categories of programmers following models both with
scientific base and without. We will try to understand what kind of
programmers we are, what kinds of mixes of people a team needs to
function, etc.
